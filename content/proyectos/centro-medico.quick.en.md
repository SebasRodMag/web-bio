# Medical Center

**Appointment Management System**
Development of a full-stack web application for a medical center specializing in appointment and examination management for companies. The system consists of a backend (Rest API) in Laravel and a frontend (SPA) in Angular, all orchestrated with Docker.

## Highlights
- **Full-Stack and DevOps Architecture**: Modern stack (Laravel + Angular) and a fully Dockerized development environment.
- **Role System**: Authentication with three well-defined profiles: **Administrator**, **Client**, and **Doctor**, each with specific access and functionality.
- **Dataflow and Database**: Database design (MySQL) focused on linking clients, their current contracts, and appointments, enabling traceability and filtered data queries.
